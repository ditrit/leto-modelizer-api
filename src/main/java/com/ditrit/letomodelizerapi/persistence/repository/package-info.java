/**
 * This package contains the repository classes for the LetoModelizer API. Repositories in this package
 * are responsible for abstracting the access to data sources and handling the persistence operations
 * for various entities in the application.
 * They provide a layer of separation between the domain model layer and the data mapping layer,
 * enabling clean architecture and easier maintenance.
 * This package is crucial for implementing the data access part of the application, following the
 * Repository design pattern.
