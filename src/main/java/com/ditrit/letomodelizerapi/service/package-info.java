/**
 * This package encompasses the service layer of the LetoModelizer API.
 * It contains service interfaces and their implementations, which provide business logic and application functionality.
 * The service layer acts as a bridge between the controllers (or REST endpoints) and the data access layer, ensuring
 * that business rules are encapsulated and data transformations are handled appropriately.
 * This package is essential for orchestrating application workflows, handling complex business logic,
 * and interacting with the repository layer to retrieve and persist data.
